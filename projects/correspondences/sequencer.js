// Turning the spin into sound.
//
// Each piece rotates at its own rate and a fixed playhead reads its figure. What sounds is
// **the marks in the row**: a solid line once, a broken line twice, a single point once, a
// double point twice. The pattern is cited data; the rate is mine.
//
// # Why this is a frame loop and not a lookahead scheduler
//
// `sounds-like` schedules with a 2 s lookahead and says why: *"the timer does not schedule
// the AUDIO, it schedules the SCHEDULING"*, which is what lets a note survive a 40 ms
// round trip to a server. That is the right design **there**, where events come from
// across a socket and the piece is written in advance.
//
// Here nothing is written in advance. A rate is a knob under your hand, and the whole
// point is that turning it changes what you hear now — so scheduling two seconds ahead
// would mean either ignoring the knob for two seconds or cancelling and rebuilding the
// queue on every movement of it. The events are also cheap and sparse: eight pieces at
// three turns a second over six steps is under 150 events a second, scheduled a frame out.
//
// What is taken from them is the part that matters at this scale: **an onset is always an
// absolute `ctx.currentTime`**, never "now", so a long frame moves the sound by the amount
// the frame was long rather than clumping every missed step onto one instant.

/// A step's onset is placed within the frame it was crossed in, rather than at the frame
/// boundary. Without this, two steps crossed in one 30 ms frame both land on the same
/// millisecond and sound as one thicker event.
