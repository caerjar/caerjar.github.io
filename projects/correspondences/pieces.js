// The placed shapes: what the surface is played with.
//
// Clicking a symbol in the atlas **places** it and navigates to it, so a walk through the
// graph leaves a trail you can hear. Each piece spins at its own rate; a fixed playhead
// reads its figure as it passes; shapes at different rates drift against each other.
//
// # What a piece's position means: nothing
//
// Where you drag a shape is yours and says nothing about the graph. The atlas behind it is
// the opposite — every position there is `system → ring, kind → radius, ordinal → angle`
// and moving a node would be a lie. So the two must not be confused, and the surface keeps
// them apart: pieces live in their own plane in front of the armillary, and dragging one
// never writes back to a position in the world.
//
// # Rate is authored, the pattern is not
//
// The steps come from the figure, which comes from a cited attribute. The *rate* is a
// control I set, like the tonic, and it is labelled so. That is also why this does not
// breach §Interface rule 6 — the rotation depicts the reading of a sequence, which is a
// procedure; it asserts nothing about the symbol.
